    <h1>This is a porting of <a href="https://amirteymuri.github.io/xmler/">Chicken Xmler</a> for Common Lisp</h1>
    <p>
      Xmler is a simple interface for creating bindings to XML-based languages like HTML, MusicXML, SVG etc. for CL.
      The main function which writes to an XML file is <code>xml</code> and has the following signature:
    </p>
    
    <pre>
      (xml elems &key (path "/tmp/etude.xml") (depth 0))
    </pre>

    <p>
      where <code>elems</code> is an element (which would result in a XML tree with one root) or a list of elements (equal to multiple roots with the same level of indentation). Each element is created by the function <code>elem</code> with the following signature:
    </p>

    <pre>
      (elem name &key attr cont (open-mark "<")
	(close-mark ">")
	(empty-close-mark "/>"))
    </pre>
